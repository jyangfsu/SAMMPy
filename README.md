Introduction
-----------------------------------------------

SSAMMPy is an open-source python package for performing process sensitivity analysis under multiple models.

SAMMPy is a modular modelling code that can simply and efficiently vary model structure (process representation), allowing for the generation and running of large model ensembles that vary in process representation, parameters, parameter values, and environmental conditions.

SAMMPy aims at contributing towards improving the quantity of sensitivity analysis with multiple models and the understanding of the complex process-based earth system models.

Installation
-----------------------------------------------

SAMMPy requires **Python** 3.7 (or higher)

The easiest way to install is via `pip`::

To install SAMMPy type:

    pip install sammpy

To update SAMMPy type:

    pip install sammpy --upgrade

To uninstall SAMMPy type:

    pip uninstall sammpy
    
## Requirements:
-----------------------------------------------

- [NumPy](https://www.numpy.org)
- [Matplotlib](https://www.scipy.org/scipylib)
- [SALib](https://salib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
    
## Getting started with the package
-----------------------------------------------

We recommend to start by executing the workflow scripts that apply the different process sensitivity analysis methods to test cases.
